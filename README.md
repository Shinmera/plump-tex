plump-tex
=========

Rudimentary parser turning TeX-like syntax into a Plump DOM. This really does nothing more at the moment than dumbly translating TeX tags to DOM nodes, which can then be serialised into XHTML.

```
(plump:serialize (plump-tex:parse "Oh hey, \\how{are you} \\holding[up=there]{with all that} {exciting stuff} going on"))
```
